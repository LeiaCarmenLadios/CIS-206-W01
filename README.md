# CIS 143 W01

## Assignment 8
We have successfully formed a team of three: Jacob Kazmierczak, Zachary Bogdanski, and Leia Ladios. 

We will be creating a Go Fish card game. 

We have also decided to use Signal as a form of communication and will be hosting our meetings through Jitsi. 

We agreed on the tasks listed on the Gantt Chart and drafted a rough UML diagram of the program we want to create. 

We have also established a schedule of weekly meetings which will be on Tuesdays and Fridays. We are also open to impromptu meetings if we feel it is necessary.

## Assignment 9
To start the process of coding our Go Fish card game, we learned how to set up the Live Share extension on Visual Studio Code and will be using that 
to collaborate and code together in real time. 

This week, we started to explore our dynamic in terms of creating a project together. This was one of Leia's first few times coding in Python and have realized how applicable some of the concepts are from other languages she is more familiar with.

We also started to develop two of our classes that we will implement in our Go Fish game, a Card class and Deck class. The Card class allows us to implement a card with suit and value attributes. The Deck class allows us to implement a playing deck built from Card objects with basic methods such as draw, shuffle and reset the deck.
