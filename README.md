# CIS 216

## Assignment 8
We have successfully formed a team of three: Jacob Kazmierczak, Zachary Bogdanski, and Leia Ladios. 

We will be creating a Go Fish card game. 

We have also decided to use Signal as a form of communication and will be hosting our meetings through Jitsi. 

We agreed on the tasks listed on the Gantt Chart and drafted a rough UML diagram of the program we want to create. 

We have also established a schedule of weekly meetings which will be on Tuesdays and Fridays. We are also open to impromptu meetings if we feel it is necessary.

## Assignment 9
To start the process of coding our Go Fish card game, we learned how to set up the Live Share extension on Visual Studio Code and will be using that 
to collaborate and code together in real time. 

This week, we started to explore our dynamic in terms of creating a project together. This was one of Leia's first few times coding in Python and have realized how applicable some of the concepts are from other languages she is more familiar with.

We revised our UML diagram from the first week to add an additional class and reconfigured some of our methods to better suit the game.

We also started to develop two of our classes that we will implement in our Go Fish game, a Card class and Deck class. The Card class allows us to implement a card with suit and value attributes. The Deck class allows us to implement a playing deck built from Card objects with basic methods such as draw, shuffle and reset the deck.

## Assignment 10
This week, we started to develop our Player class to add to our Card, Deck, and Hand classes. The Player class has proven to be a challenge as it incorporates much of the Game class that we have not yet created. 

We also added properties back to our Card class and will continue to augment some of our other classes to also utilize properties.

Revisions have been made so that we have a basic Game class to test our Player class accurately and mimic how it would look like in an actual game. 

We think we are a little bit behind on our progress and are hoping we get caught up by getting a good portion of the Player and Game class implemented. We would like to have as much done by Thanksgiving as possible as well. 

## Assignment 11
This week, we refined some of our unit tests for our Card and Deck classes to make our testing more complete. We also started to add unit tests for our Hand class. 

In addition to testing, we also added some validation to our Card and Player classes to check that the user input is valid.

We revised some of the methods in each of our classes based on issues discovered through more thorough testing. We spent a lot of time troubleshooting as a team and keeping track of what variables were doing to figure out an issue with how we were looping through a range while changing the range. This helped us learn how to debug better in the future.

We are still a little behind in our Player and Game class implementation. We managed to bolster some of our testing for our other classes which should allow us to focus on our Player and Game classes this week.

## Assignment 12
This week we started creating a main program underneath the game class so that we can get a text based program going. 

We have been working on looping the prompts at the beginning of the game and moving different methods around where they make better sense to be. 

We are constantly updating our UML diagram and we have found it useful as the program is large which would make remembering the variables and methods difficult to remember. 

We came into some problems when it came to naming different attributes. We noticed that we had named some attributes and variables the same name and that confused us.

We will start implementing more descriptive naming conventions.

## Assignment 13
This week, we started working on a GUI implementation of the text based Go Fish Game. 

This was our first time working with Tkinter to create a GUI. We were able to create some basic frames containing buttons, labels, menus and text windows. We were also able to get the canvas to clear each time we want to display a new page based on button inputs.

With some Tkinter basics under our belt, we plan to start incorporating elements of our text based game into GUI form.

We have also picked out the card design that we want to use and draw onto the Canvas. We have put it inside a file called Cards inside the Assignment 13 folder.

## Assignment 14
This week, we continued to work on the game introduction which included displaying game rules, and initializing the number of players and their names.

We are now starting to work on the card game portion itself and deciding on our design for the player canvas.
