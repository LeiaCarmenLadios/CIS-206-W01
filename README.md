# CIS 143 W01

## Assignment 8
We have successfully formed a team of three: Jacob Kazmierczak, Zachary Bogdanski, and Leia Ladios. 

We will be creating a Go Fish card game. 

We have also decided to use Signal as a form of communication and will be hosting our meetings through Jitsi. 

We agreed on the tasks listed on the Gantt Chart and drafted a rough UML diagram of the program we want to create. 

We have also established a schedule of weekly meetings which will be on Tuesdays and Fridays. We are also open to impromptu meetings if we feel it is necessary.
